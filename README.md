# ü¶´ Secure your CI with Cimon

![](./pics/cimon-cover.png)

[Cimon](https://cimon.build) (pronounced "Simon") is a runtime security solution that detects and stops software supply-chain attacks on your pipeline, including those targeting SolarWinds and CodeCov, through easy onboarding and a developer-friendly experience.

By utilizing the revolutionary eBPF technology, Cimon monitors and mitigates attacks within the kernel, denying access to users' assets as soon as they arise.

Get started by installing the [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/cimon-by-cycode), or learn more in our docs section - https://docs.cimon.build.

This action helps seamlessly deploy the agent into any desired GitHub Actions build. The action is based on the NodeJS engine and contains simple `pre` and `post` scripts to deploy and gracefully shut down the agent.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started with Cimon

Here's a simple three-step process to begin securing your GitHub Actions pipeline:

- Step 1 - Install Cimon [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/cimon-by-cycode). You will be directed to the Cimon platform once the process is complete. 
- Step 2 - Generate an API key in the Cimon Platform, which consists of a client ID and a secret. These keys are used to authenticate the user and should be securely stored as GitHub Actions secrets.
- Step 3 - Add Cimon action to your workflow as the first step

We recommend starting Cimon in ‚ÄúDetect Mode‚Äù to allow it to learn your environment before applying preventive policies.

``` yaml
- uses: cycodelabs/cimon-action@v0
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.CIMON_CLIENT_ID }}
    secret: ${{ secrets.CIMON_SECRET }}
```

## üî® Usage

The action supports the following parameters:

| Name                     | Default                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This setting is mandatory if your workflow runs containers attached to a custom network with configured sub-range. In other words, inter-container networking is usually ignored by Cimon. Cimon implicitly ignores 10.0.0.0/8 and 172.16.0.0/12 networks. |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Report

Each pipeline run will report its findings through a security report embedded within the pipeline summary in GitHub Actions. 

Here is an example of a Cimon report:

The report, created as a job summary, contains the profile of the running job based on the configuration and includes a snippet to assist the user with transitioning from detection to prevention.

When the policy is set to "prevent", any security anomalies matching the profile are displayed on the report:

## ü™ö Development

Contributions to GitHub Action are welcome. After changes were made to the `src` folder, these changes should be reflected to the `dist` folder through the following build process:

1. Install or update package dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Compile JavaScript source files into single entrypoint files with [ncc]:
   ```
   npm run all
   ```

The build script will update the actions' entry points code in the [dist](dist) directory, which should be added to the Git repository.
